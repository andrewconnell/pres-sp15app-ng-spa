SharePoint-Hosted Apps
======================
All resources required to implemented app stored in an AppWeb & served up by SharePoint



Single Page Apps
================
One page, multiple screens yet no traditional page refreshes



Why Build Single Page Apps (SPAs)?
----------------------------------
- Reduced round tripping to the server
- Works great in low bandwidth & offline
- Highly interactive



Characteristics of Single Page Apps?
------------------------------------
- Routing & navigation
- Page history
- Deep linking
- Templated views & data binding



Why SharePoint hosted Apps as SPAs?
-----------------------------------
- Minimal additional deployment steps (*sort of*)
- **No extra costs** & concerns
- SPA's yield a **richer user experience**
- SPA's facilitate **modular app development**
- Leverage SharePoint for services & data storage



Organizing your Project
-----------------------
- Put all JavaScript libraries / vendor scripts in `/Scripts`
  - Just like `References` is for server side assemblies
- Put your custom JavaScript in `/App`

  *Why?* Because you don't want to mix your custom code with scripts & libraries with

  *Recommendation:* Look at [John Papa's](http://www.twitter.com/john_papa) [AngularJS style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide), specifically the section on [application structure](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide#application-structure)

Thinking Ahead...
=================
- Challenging stuff
- Cool techniques



Challenging stuff
-----------------
- SharePoint creates a new AppWeb & throws away the old one when updating the app
  - Storing app data in AppWeb's lists/libraries? **You'll lose it all on updates!**
- Handling app authentication (tokens)
  - **DO NOT RETURN OAUTH ACCESS TOKENS TO CLIENT**
  - May need an intermediary (*see Research Project Code Sample in **Resources** section for example*)



Cool techniques
---------------
- Use Google Analytics & virtual page views & custom events to track app usage
- Externalize JavaScript & CSS references to a CDN
  - Enables app updates without actually updating the SharePoint app
  - Doesn't help with new views
- Utilize A/B testing to see what UX works better for your users
  - Combined with Google Analytics => killer customer service offered to your customers
- Use SharePoint workflows to protect sensitive business logic
  - If server-side code needed, have workflow call it... app never sees where it went / came from
- Use BCS External Lists to hide where external data came from
